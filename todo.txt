DONE - Fix controls
DONE - Add friction to ball so doesn't slide off
DONE - Wall jump
DONE - Enemies/harmful things, lives system
DONE - Burrowing & Get more pieces generated by tokens on the blocks after they're placed

general polish:
DONE - sound effects
DONE - particle effects

 - lower terminal velocity
 - put number of pieces left on top of cursor
 - fix overlapping boxes
DONE - fix super big jump when w and space
 - chunks hang in air shake then start falling
 - best pieces have higher chance of spike
 - thin platforms one way platforms
 - cover up spike sound effect
 - do not let player place overlapping things
 - worm enemy

backburner:
 - have to have at least one chunk left for the tokens that give you more chunks to spawn in
 - zero gravity for chunk
